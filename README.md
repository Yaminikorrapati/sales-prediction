Sales Prediction using Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project aims to forecast product sales based on historical sales data. By analyzing various factors such as advertising spend, promotions, and customer segmentation, the model helps businesses optimize marketing strategies for sales growth.

Dataset

The dataset contains customer-related information, including:

Age

Annual Salary

Credit Card Debt

Net Worth

Car Purchase Amount (Target Variable)


Steps in the Project

1. Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Detecting outliers

Feature scaling



2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Statistical summary

Data visualization (boxplots, histograms, correlation heatmaps)



3. Feature Engineering

Encoding categorical variables

Creating new features if necessary



4. Model Selection

Comparing different regression models

Hyperparameter tuning



5. Model Evaluation

Performance metrics (RÂ², MAE, RMSE)

Cross-validation



6. Deployment & Documentation

Structuring the GitHub repository

Providing clear documentation on methodology and findings




Installation & Requirements

To run this project, install the required dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Usage

Run the analysis script:

python sales_prediction.py
